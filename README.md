# The provided code is a simple Python script that implements two text-based games: Rock Paper Scissors and World Atlas. Let's break down the functionality and features of each part:
- Rock Paper Scissors Game:
In this game, the user competes against the computer in a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. The user selects their choice ('r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors), and the computer randomly selects its choice. The outcome is determined by the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The result is displayed to the user, indicating whether they won, lost, or tied with the computer.
- World Atlas Game:
In this game, the user is presented with a series of questions about world capitals. The user is asked to guess the capital of a randomly selected country from a predefined dictionary containing country-capital pairs. The user inputs their answer, and the program checks if it matches the correct capital. The user's score is calculated based on the number of correct answers out of the total questions asked. At the end of the game, the user's final score is displayed.
- The main() function serves as the entry point of the program. It presents the user with a game menu, allowing them to choose between playing Rock Paper Scissors or the World Atlas game. After playing a game, the user is given the option to continue playing or exit the program.
- Thus, the code provides a simple and interactive gaming experience for users. It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as user input, randomization, conditional statements, loops, and dictionary manipulation.
